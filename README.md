# Dante Esteban Cort√©s Ganoza

Hi, my name is Dante Cort√©s, I'm a web developer Full Stack.  
  
I started programming in C++, C# and Java during my studing days, now I develop web systems with Laravel, Vue, React, MySQL and I'm not afraid of taking new development tools.  
Also, I create content on my youtube channel ["Tech Cort√©s"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwqXR2Z_2emS6ICXnCVw31A) where I show my experiences programming and try new programming tools.
